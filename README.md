# music-streaming-codeclause
# this is my golden project of my web development intern at Codeclause , the project was to make a Music Streaming Web Application i made that using HTML, CSS And Vanilla JS. The songs added in the app are either made by the author of the project or either have been taken from NCS.COM( meaning they are free to use ). For hosting , i made the use of Github Pages .
